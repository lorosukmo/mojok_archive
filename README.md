# mojok_archive
Website archiving project for Mojok.co website, based on scrapping.

This website is being shutting down starting from 28 March 2017. Starting from that cause, we take initiative to archiving this portal. The file is ready to use with csv format, including articles of the website. More than 1000 article are already scrapped within this file. 

You can open this file with Ms. Excel to read the content. For reading comfort, you can copy the column called "paragraph" to the Ms. Word, blog, or anywhere.

This file is for research purpose only and copyrights belong to it's author and owner.

If you have similiar project or idea to discuss, especially for web archiving, drop me email to mail@nafiputrawan.space.
